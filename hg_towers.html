      <h2>Rule an Ancient City</h2>
      <p>
        Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer Medal for Best New
        Simulation Board Game. Players adopt role cards of characters from
        ancient Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage the administration of a
        city. Each role provides a different ability and strategy. However, one
        role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players must be constantly
        aware of betrayal and double-cross. This card game provides a ton of
        enjoyment and can handle up to eight players and expansion packs
        available for larger parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must carefully choose
        his or her roles and the strategies can quickly change with the turn of
        a card. However the level of randomness is just right and cunning and
        resourcefulness can overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not
        recommend this game unless there are at least 4 players; less than that
        reduces the intrigue and some of the game appeal.

        Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is just about perfect
        and each player must carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the
        strategic possibilities are nearly endless, the game is simple to learn.
        The replay value is high and gets even better when you replace some of
        the cards with new cards available in the expansion packs.

      <h2>Great Strategic Board Game</h2>
      <p>
        We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 to 6 players and we
        can strongly recommend the game. The different phases of the game are
        interesting and intriguing, from bluffing and stealing to site
        construction and planning. With the variety of cards and scenarios, no
        two games are ever quite the same. It's a great introduction to the
        world of strategic board games and role playing.

      <h2>An Incredible Game</h2>
      <p>
        The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent and one of the best
        around. As for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there are
        tough decisions to make every turn. It's not only important to select
        the character that increases your chances for scoring, but also to
        anticipate the characters the opponents are likely to select, and then
        hedge against their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability
        and deep strategic thinking. However, it can still be played at a more
        basic level for younger users.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as Best in its Class.
        Highly recommended.
