      <h2>Decide the Fate of the World</h2>
      <p>
        Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide the outcome. As one
        of the world powers battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
        military drive; but you can't do it alone. You have to form alliances
        and then betray your allies before they betray you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity of the strike.
        Will it be a bombing raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion
        with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, move into enemy territory
        with your forces and win the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. Buy armaments and
        develop secret weapons from your country's economic funds and natural
        reserves, but be sure to save something for the future.

        The list of war simulation games is long. All of them share similar
        features including the formation of temporary Alliance and battles
        simulated through random draws of a deck or the roll of the die.
        Alliance offers very little that is new or innovative in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
        We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. In fact, I dare say
        we spent more time reading and rereading the rule book than actually
        playing the game. If you want to read a book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.

      <h2>Decent Game but Many are Better</h2>
      <p>
        Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the game play to be
        robust and engaging. The rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone
        with experience in this class of board games, there is little there
        that's unexpected or difficult. We think the battle simulation cards are
        some of the best we have encountered.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of that being said, the competition for this type of game is fierce.
        There are a lot of established titles with loyal clients. We're not
        exactly sure where Alliance fits in with that group. It's a good game,
        but not good enough to draw our attention away from games like Battle
        Tested and Global Conflict.

      <h2>Fun and Challenging</h2>
      <p>
        Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to war game enthusiasts. We
        think it offers several new ideas that we're surprised have not been
        utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the investment
        options give the game a "real world" feel.

      <h2>Things We Liked</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Variety of Battle Scenarios</li>
        <li>Flexible Rules and Setup</li>
        <li>Detail and Historical Accuracy</li>
        <li>Wealth of Expansion Packs</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Things We Hated</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Long and Complicated Rule Book</li>
        <li>Setup takes too Long</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may
        have trouble with the rules and may be bored
